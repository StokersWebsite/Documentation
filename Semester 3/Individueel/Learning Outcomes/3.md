[[Learning Outcomes]]
3. You **choose** and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

_Choose_: 
You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

## How I did this in semester 3
For the group project we used Scrum([[Agile]]) as our agile method. We did this using Taiga. This is a program that allows you to make a board per sprint that has all tasks which you can assign to people. We chose scrum since the finnish students had used this method before and would like to do it again. We used taiga as our scrum software and had a taiga project for the front-and-back end so we could see each others progress.
