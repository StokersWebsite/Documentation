## Finland
For me the cultural differences were very visable since I worked on the Oulu project with finnish students. I feel like that we as dutch students inherited a lot of the finnish ways of doing things. Like taiga, We had all never heard of it, but since the finnish students had and liked it we decided to use it for this project aswell.

## Ethics
For [[Ethics]] we had to think of ways that our application might affect its users.
Our group application is a social media application, As such our users would be able to chat with each other. This in and of itself could be problematic since it could be used to insult other people. Our application is also based on group activities, this means users could exclude other users from a certain activity, this would [inflict harm](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics#:~:text=locally%20and%20globally.-,1.2%20Avoid%20harm.,-In%20this%20document) to other users using our software.
