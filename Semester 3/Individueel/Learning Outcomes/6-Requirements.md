[[Learning Outcomes]]
6. You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using **multiple types of test techniques**.

_Multiple types of test techniques_ : 
You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

## teachers
I had multiple stakeholders including my teachers, cv de stokers members and myself.
For the "user acceptance" of the teachers I ofcourse had feedback moments and casual conversations (with leon) about my project and progress. I did this because then I got to know more about what still had to be done. And I got some good tips on how to move forward.

## Stokers members
I also got feedback from Stokers members, first of all about the requirements ofcourse. I did this at the start because I wanted to know what all the members wanted in the site. 
From this I learned that most members would like a activities tab on which they can see what events are comming up, which I then added to the requirements.

## Sonarcloud
To test my code I used sonarcloud

I used sonarcloud because then I could find everything that was not neat code easily.
For example if I imported something that I didnt use it would show me in what file I did so.
This came in very handy to clean up my code.
