[[Learning Outcomes]]
8. You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.

_Professional manner_ : 
You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions. You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

## how?
For me this was both the easiest and the hardest to prove. I felt like everything I did this semester like the group project, my feedback usage and my on logical thinking based decisions proved that I acted in a professional manner. Even so I was never really sure if this was the way to show this.
