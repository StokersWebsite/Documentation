# Agile methods used by software developers

by Rens Vlooswijk

## Introduction

There are more than one ways to work as a group on a large project.
There is no correct answer to which method is the best, it is all based on personal preference, even so there are certain pro's and cons to certain methods.
But the overall idea of agile is a flexible work method.

### The Finland project

Our group project was in cooperation with a group of Finnish students.
3 members of our group went to Finland in February to establish a connection with the other students and think of a project that we could work on for the coming months.
In may those same Finnish students came to the Netherlands to finish the project.

### Scrum 
(Rens Vlooswijk)

We decided to use the Scrum method which is extremely versatile. It allows you to change your goals on a day to day or week to week basis. This makes task way easier to oversee and get done. It also provides a more joyous work experience since you get a task done basically every day which is very satisfying.

### Roles:

##### Product owner

The product owner is in close contact with the person or company giving the assignment
He makes most of the decisions and can add items to the backlog if the stakeholders requests them.

#### Scrum master

He is basically the groups coach, He oversees the project and tries to get the team to function optimally .

#### Developer / team member

They are the people that create most of the assignment.
This is the remainder of the developers, they code under the "Supervision" of the scrum master and try to get as much of the requirements done in time.

### What do I need

First of all you create a product backlog, this contains all the items that you are planning on making divided in small tasks which you can finish in about a day.

Then you need a sprint backlog, a sprint is 2 to 4 weeks depending on the size of the project, in which you try to finish a certain part of the assignment.

The sprint backlog is similar to the product backlog but it only has all the tasks that you are planning to do in that sprint.

You also need acceptation criteria, these are predetermined criteria of when you consider a task to be complete. These are decided by the group at the beginning and make sure that when you finish a task everybody is satisfied and it doesnâ€™t need changing.

And last but not least you need a scrum board, A place that shows all the tasks and in what stage of completion they are.
This board is divided in sprints as well and you can assign a task to someone who will then be responsible for that part of the project.
