## What is obsidian?
>Obsidian is a note management software, it is used to organize all notes in a different way than most. It encourages you to create lots of notes and link them with other notes. This way you create a web of notes in which you can easily find what you are looking for.

This way you can make a obsidian "vault" of for example school, which then has folders dedicated to different semesters. And each semester can have folders about all your projects which in turn contain everything you made for that project.

## Why use obsidian?
>The main reason to use obsidian is its organizing value. For me personaly, I have always had trouble organizing my projects. In the end I could never find what I was looking for, and I even made certain diagrams and reports twice because I thought I had lost them.
But not with obsidian, It can be very organized if used correctly. 
Furthermore it combines multiple programs into one, again if used correctly. Also when another developer needs to take over a project (and has obsidian) He can easily read through everything and get to know exactly what the project is all about and what you have done so far.

## How to start using obsidian?
>Obviously start by [downloading Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) . When this is done there are two main ways to start. If you take over someones obsidian vault you can download and then open that folder. Otherwise you can create a vault, In this vault you can then add folders for all things you want your vault to be about, Then add the notes themselves. You can add as many notes as you want, this mean you can have either a main vault or vaults for specific topics.

Me for example, I have a vault for "school" and in this vault I have folders for every semester. I also combined this vault with "De Stokers". This is our carnavals organisation, but also my school project. This way I can easily explain to the stokers members what the school project is about (a stokers website) and to my teachers what the stokers are about.

## (community) Plugins
>To properly use obsidians I would recommend to use some plugins.
>You can get plugins by going to settings in the bottom right and look for plugins.
>There are two types of plugins, core plugins and community plugins. The core plugins are the ones that obsidian themselves support and are easy to use and handy plugins.
>For community plugins you will need to turn off safe mode:

Then you can browse for community plugins. There are plugins for almost everything you can think of. Pretty much all plugins have a tutorial on how to use them on their download page. 
When you find the plugins you need obsidian can replace a lot of other programs. For example the kanban plugin. You can create a kanban board in obsidian. This is extremely handy since you can have backlinks (links to different notes) in the tasks on the kanban board to instantly show you what was done for this task. This takes over the tasks of programs like trello or taiga.
And there are many more like this.

## The cons of obsidian
>The main con of obsidian is that not everybody has it, this means that if you want to share your vault which is neatly worked out with all kinds of handy things, the person you want to share it with needs obsidian to easily view everything.
Another minor con of obsidian is that it is hard to get into, It takes a while to use it optimally. And lastly it uses markdown, which is a very positive thing for some people but it can be problematic for others. Since it is based on personal preference and experience.

## Is obsidian worth using?
>Yes, I personally think so. It has helped me tremendously with organisation and general use of documentation when it comes to software. I can see why it is not for everybody, but when used to its potential it is extremely usefull and definitely worth checking out.
