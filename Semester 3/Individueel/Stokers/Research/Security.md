# Security research

## introduction
One of the main obstacles when creating software is its security. Since if it is not done correctly it can easily be abused to steal personal or financial information.
Furthermore there are lots of different ways to secure your application or website.
But also lots of ways for it to be problamatic if you dont do it correctly.

## How much security does a project need?
How much security a project needs varies a lot from project to project.
For example a crud application doesnt need a lot or any security since there wont be valuable information on it that can be stolen. Plus it will probably not be used by other people. A big / popular application like the rabobank app for example does need lots of security. This makes sense ofcourse since this application stores important date like bank account numbers.

## Ways to improve your software
- ### Think of security from the beginning
	If you start your project oblivious to security it will be way harder to implement than when you start from the beginning. It is even better when you think of how you are going to secure your project before writing any code.
- ### Use a security framework
	There are frameworks to increase security, This will most likely be secured a lot better than if you create your own security from scratch.
	It will also add structure and consistancy across the entirety of the group
- ### Set up requirements in advance
	You can make sure the security standards are the same on all parts of the project by establishing the security requirements before you start the project. 
- ### protect the code itself
	Save all the code in a protected repository, this way you can manage everybody that can alter the code and oversee all changes.
- ### Review and test your code constantly
	You can find most of your vulnerabilitys by repeatedly testing your code
	If you can remove them before you launch your code the chances of it getting breached are a lot smaller.
